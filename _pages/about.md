# Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Harvey ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a **Postdoctoral Associate** at **Cornell University**, working under the guidance of [Dr. Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz and Dr. Azahara Oliva](https://braincomputation.org/).  

My research explores **how neural circuits give rise to behavior and memory**. I combine **large-scale electrophysiology**, **closed-loop optogenetics**, and **computational analysis** to understand how the hippocampus organizes experience into lasting memories.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Path  

- **Purdue University (B.A., 2014)**  
  I began my scientific journey at Purdue, where I explored **human navigation and memory** in virtual environments with Dr. Carol Lawton, and later recorded **single-unit hippocampal neurons** in freely moving rodents with Dr. Ryan Yoder ([Harvey et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.034)).  

- **University of New Mexico (M.Sc., 2016; Ph.D.)**  
  As a Masterâ€™s student with Dr. Benjamin Clark, I studied how the **anterior thalamus contributes to spatial memory** using selective temporary inactivations ([Clark & Harvey, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2016.06.002); [Harvey et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00094)).  

  During my doctoral work, I examined how **developmental alcohol exposure** impacts hippocampal place cell coding and **sharp-wave ripple** activity ([Harvey et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.09.018); [2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.077); [2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.450435)).

## ðŸ”¬ Current Research  

Now in the **Fernandez-Ruiz & Oliva Lab**, Iâ€™m investigating the **diversity of ripple-associated cell sequences** using:  

âœ… **Closed-loop optogenetics**  
âœ… **High-density silicon probe recordings**  
âœ… **Advanced analytical tools**  

This work aims to unravel how **hippocampal ripples coordinate memory reactivation**, and how we can precisely manipulate them ([Harvey et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.04.015); [Soula et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2302676120); [Karaba et al., 2024](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado5708)).

## ðŸ›  Open-Source Tools  

Iâ€™m passionate about building reproducible, scalable tools for neuroscience research:  

- ðŸ§  [`neuro_py`](https://ryanharvey1.github.io/neuro_py/): My primary tool for **analyzing large-scale neurophysiology datasets**, with support for spike trains, LFPs, and behavioral analysis.  
- ðŸ“¦ [`nelpy`](https://nelpy.github.io/nelpy/): A flexible framework for **time series analysis of neuronal ensembles**.  

You can find more of my tools and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanharvey1).
